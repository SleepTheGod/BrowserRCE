How This Works as an RCE PoC
Stress Induction
Creates 1000 SpeechRecognition instances per batch, 50 times (50,000 total attempts).
Uses rapid start/stop cycles with tiny delays (1-50ms) to create race conditions.
Sets continuous=true and maxAlternatives=10 to maximize resource usage.
Debugging: Use Chrome’s --enable-logging=stderr --v=1 flags and a debugger to catch crashes or memory errors.
Exploit Development: If you get a crash, analyze the call stack and memory state to build a full RCE chain (e.g., overwrite a function pointer or control flow).
Report: Submit findings to Google VRP with detailed reproduction steps.
Caveats This is a generic PoC framework, not a guaranteed RCE. Its success depends on an actual (unknown to me) vulnerability in Chrome’s implementation as of March 9, 2025.
Adjust batchSize, maxRuns, or timing if it’s too aggressive or not triggering anything.
